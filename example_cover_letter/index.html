Letter Dear Jane Street Recruiting Team,
I would be overjoyed to work at Jane Street! I greatly admire your contributions to OCaml and I&rsquo;m excited that you have successfully applied my deepest passions to the industry! My background is primary in compilers and HPC, and I&rsquo;ve always had an interest in programming language design. Recently, I started research focused in compilers and quantum computing. My team in the TINKER lab is building a terse functional language for qunatum computers embedded in Python with a fully linear type system. Linear logic The same logical foundations which are used in Rust&rsquo;s borrow checker and your related work that introduces uniqueness-tracking into OCaml&rsquo;s type system. We are also leveraging MLIR to help us produce faster code than competing languages and libraries like Q# and Qiskit.

<p>Dear Jane Street Recruiting Team,</p>
<p>I would be overjoyed to work at Jane Street! I greatly admire your contributions to OCaml and I&rsquo;m excited that you have successfully
applied my deepest passions to the industry!
My background is primary in compilers and HPC, and I&rsquo;ve always had an interest in programming language design.
Recently, I started research focused in compilers and quantum computing. My team in the TINKER lab is building
a terse functional language for qunatum computers embedded in Python with a fully linear type system.
Linear logic The same logical foundations which are used in Rust&rsquo;s borrow checker and your related work
that introduces uniqueness-tracking into OCaml&rsquo;s type system. We are also leveraging MLIR to help us produce faster code than
competing languages and libraries like Q# and Qiskit.</p>
<p>Ever since I started programming when I was young, I have never been satsified with black-boxes. I really resonated with the paragraph
on your blog that states you are looking for people who are motivated to dig deep to understand how something <em>truly</em> works. I strongly
believe that to properly evaluate the merits of any layer of abstraction, one must understand the problem that motivated the abstraction
and how it relates to your own problem. A paper that comes to mind is &ldquo;Arrakis: The Operating System is the Control Plane&rdquo; (OSDI 2014), which highlights
that even operating system primitives which are made to be performant can add significant overhead to certain applications compared to
programming the hardware directly.</p>
<p>I wrote a time-travelling simulator and debugger for the LC-2200 ISA in Haskell as a side project. While I have yet to finish it, I had started
the project when I was first learning functional programming and wanted to test if I had discovered an instance of a &ldquo;fold&rdquo; in a real application,
i.e. folding the machine&rsquo;s state over a history of changes to rewind it. If I were to make it faster, perhaps I could find a way to group transactions together.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my application! If you have any further questions, please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:choechst3@gatech.edu">choechst3@gatech.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Cameron Hoechst</p>
