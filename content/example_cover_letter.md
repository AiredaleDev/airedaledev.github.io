Here is an example cover letter for a (pipe dream) [job posting](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/5869205002/)

I don't have "outstanding research experience" yet, and this position is really aimed at PhDs.
I have yet to decide if I want to pursue that path. Five years is a large opportunity cost.

## Letter

Dear Jane Street Recruiting Team,

I would be overjoyed to work at Jane Street! I greatly admire your contributions to OCaml and I'm excited that you have successfully
applied my deepest passions to the industry!
My background is primary in compilers and HPC, and I've always had an interest in programming language design. 
Recently, I started research focused in compilers and quantum computing. My team in the TINKER lab is building
a terse functional language for qunatum computers embedded in Python with a fully linear type system.
Linear logic The same logical foundations which are used in Rust's borrow checker and your related work
that introduces uniqueness-tracking into OCaml's type system. We are also leveraging MLIR to help us produce faster code than
competing languages and libraries like Q# and Qiskit.

Ever since I started programming when I was young, I have never been satsified with black-boxes. I really resonated with the paragraph
on your blog that states you are looking for people who are motivated to dig deep to understand how something _truly_ works. I strongly
believe that to properly evaluate the merits of any layer of abstraction, one must understand the problem that motivated the abstraction
and how it relates to your own problem. A paper that comes to mind is "Arrakis: The Operating System is the Control Plane" (OSDI 2014), which highlights
that even operating system primitives which are made to be performant can add significant overhead to certain applications compared to 
programming the hardware directly.

I wrote a time-travelling simulator and debugger for the LC-2200 ISA in Haskell as a side project. While I have yet to finish it, I had started
the project when I was first learning functional programming and wanted to test if I had discovered an instance of a "fold" in a real application,
i.e. folding the machine's state over a history of changes to rewind it. If I were to make it faster, perhaps I could find a way to group transactions together.

Thank you for considering my application! If you have any further questions, please reach out to me at choechst3@gatech.edu.

Cheers!

Cameron Hoechst
