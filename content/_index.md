# Greetings!

{{< image src="/assets/img/CameronHoechst-GT-IDphoto.jpeg" alt="There should be a picture of me here, why isn't it loading?" >}}

I am a Georgia Tech BS+MS computer science student and I'm passionate about compilers, computer architecture, and HPC.
I've recently joined the TINKER research group on campus where I work on QWERTY, a terse, "basis-oriented" functional language for quantum computers.
I've also participated in SC23, an international supercomputing competition.

I've also served as a TA for four semesters for CS 2340, where I coached students on their semester-long team projects.

Here you can find my professional history.
