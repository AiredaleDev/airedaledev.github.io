# Greetings!

{{<image src="img/ch.png" alt="There should be a picture of me here, why isn't it loading?" style="border-radius: 4px">}}

I am a Georgia Tech BS+MS computer science student who is passionate about compilers, computer architecture, and HPC.
I've recently joined the TINKER research group on campus where I work on QWERTY, a terse, "basis-oriented" functional language for quantum computers.
While I'd love to share a link to the source code, we just submitted the paper to CGO 2025 this past Thursday! As such, we're waiting until we publish 
the paper before open-sourcing the project. I've also participated in [IndySCC 2023](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/students/indyscc/), an international 
supercomputing competition where teams of six build and maintains a compute cluster running scientific applications.

This past summer, I interned for the [Georgia Tech Open Source Program Office](https://ospo.cc.gatech.edu/vsip/) where I contributed to [MFC](https://mflowcode.github.io),
an exascale fluid dynamics simulation.

I've also served as a TA for four semesters for CS 2340, where I coached students on their semester-long team projects.
