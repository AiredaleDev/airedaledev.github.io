# Greetings!

{{<image src="img/ch.png" alt="There should be a picture of me here, why isn't it loading?" style="border-radius: 4px">}}

I am a Georgia Tech BS+MS computer science student and I'm passionate about compilers, computer architecture, and HPC.
I've recently joined the TINKER research group on campus where I work on QWERTY, a terse, "basis-oriented" functional language for quantum computers.
I've also participated in SC23, an international supercomputing competition.

This past summer, I interned for the [Georgia Tech Open Source Program Office](https://ospo.cc.gatech.edu/vsip/) where I contributed to an exascale fluid dynamics simulation.

I've also served as a TA for four semesters for CS 2340, where I coached students on their semester-long team projects.
