Here is an example cover letter for a (pipe dream) job posting: https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/7527332002/

Dear Jane Street Recruiting Team,

I would be overjoyed to work at Jane Street! My background is primary in systems, and I've always had an interest in programming language design.
My research is focused in compilers, 

I have always loved peeling back layers of abstraction. Through understanding how an abstraction layer works, I learn what motivated someone to build
the abstraction in the first place, and 

I wrote a time-travelling simulator and debugger in Haskell to test my understanding

My favorite aspect of programming language design is how different logics (like linear logic) can be used to implement seemingly innocuous design decisions.

If you have any further questions, please reach out to me at choechst3@gatech.edu.

Cheers!

Cameron Hoechst
